- Act as orchestrator: plan, decompose into tasks, spawn subagents. Prefer delegation over direct work.
- Collaborate on design and implementation options. Document key learnings in ~/.claude/plans for context recovery.
- Spawn subagents to critically review our work.
- I don't want you to bother me unless necessary, prefer readonly tools over tools that require writes

# Code Style
- Comment on public interfaces, but only add comments to internals if something is unintuitive
